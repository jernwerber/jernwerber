I've been a developer on the web for at least a decade, cutting my teeth on _ye olde Internet_ back when server-side includes (SSI), Macromedia Flash, and Adobe Contribute were all the rage. Since then I've used everything[^1] from **PHP** (and Drupal), to **Wordpress** (both pre- and post-Gutenberg's introduction), to **ASP** and **C#.NET**, to **Python** (with Django), all mixed with a healthy dose of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. 

[^1]: I'd be remiss if I didn't find some way to include the quality time spent during my engineering and computer science undergraduate degrees (B.A.Sc. chemical engineering & B.Sc. computing technology) with crowd favourite **Java**.

I'm a maker[^2] by nature and that manifests in my pursuit of hobbies and the work that I do. I've spent a significant amount of time--both volunteering and working--in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, especially in the area of digital skills (e.g., coding, digital design, and digital art) development. Most recently, I was with **Canada Learning Code** (pre-January 2024 layoffs), serving as their learning experience designer for adult programs, creating learning experiences on a wide variety of technical topics such as introductory **web development** (basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript); **procedural art and interactive experiences** using Processing, JavaScript and Python; introductory **cybersecurity**, **search engine optimization (SEO)** concepts and practices; **SQL** and relational database usage; and **basic/fundamental digital productivity skills** (e.g., using Google Drive Applications).

[^2]: I have a whole thing about the use of this particular word that I won't get into right now. Suffice it to say, I recognize that it is a term that is not without its own baggage, however it is also a term that carries some general & more widely understood meaning, so I'm using it here out of expedience moreso than as an endorsement.

In my spare time (and sometimes as part of work), I tinker with electronics. While taking introductions to both computer engineering and electrical engineering were mandatory, we didn't cover much in the way of circuit design-- a lot of truth tables, logic gates, flip flops, and Ohm's law, not a lot of MOSFETs, optocouplers, and flyback diodes. I find robotics and physical computing, especially using easy-to-use and widely available microcontrollers--such as the BBC micro:bit, any Arduino or Espressif (ESP) device, or Raspberry Pi Pico--to be particularly fascinating. Perhaps its the latent science fiction nerd in me, but there's something about seeing code in action _in physical space_ that just tickles my brain.

Previous to that, I worked on contract for Canada's largest STEM education outreach non-profit, **Actua**, serving as their coding education specialist and working with topics such as **artificial intelligence** and **machine learning**; **digital agriculture**; **internet safety** and **cryptography**.


 At Actua, I spent some time learning about, and working with, the micro:bit--designing content around it, and experimenting with enhancing its usefulness by authoring new MakeCode extensions for use in the MakeCode IDE. I've used the micro:bit for other projects and I've found it to be handy, with its raft of onboard sensors, LED matrix, and a radio module in the ISM (2.4 GHz) band that lets it communicate with other micro:bits (should you program it to do so, naturally) but what really stands out to me is how you can interchangeably work in a block;based
